              I am a very big fan of 'the cloud' and abstracting the infrasture away from projects so you can put more focus on the code.
              I have experience with AWS and have used a many services they offer.

            <p>
              See the video below (to the right on desktop) to see a real live demo of Youni  !
            </p>
            <p>
              I created the mobile application Youni (no longer on app store) as apart of a startup venture I took on, acting
              as the Lead Developer and CTO.  The app was developed with <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a>
              for the front-end.  I prototyped an API using Grails, the API was the real brain of the application that
              handled everything from authentication to generating post feeds and more.  The front end React Native project
              was lean and only served as a light rendering engine that made calls to the API.  The API was hosted using services
              provided by AWS.  I used MongoDB as my datastore.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reflection:  I am happy with the performanace of the app.  It handled thousands of users and thanks to AWS I was
              able to host the API in a scalable load balanced environment that scaled up as the API received more traffic.
              In hindsight I would choose a different technology to create the API, since Grails had a slow startup time and
              was a bit heavy weight for what I needed at the time.

            <p>
              View the plugin <a href="https://grails.org/plugin/shiro-guard">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note: I created this plugin during the summer of 2014 while I was a full-time intern at
              <a href="http://www.commercehub.com/">CommerceHub</a>.  It is now deprecated and no longer maintained.
              However it is important to note this plugin was used in production for two years and it was a great personal accomplishment at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
              This plugin builds upon the <a href="http://grails.org/plugin/shiro">Apache Shiro Plugin</a> by adding a way to check to see if a user can
              access a URL, at the time of the request.  Without this plugin an authenticated user would gain permission to RESTful URLs either
              through a Role DB object, or through a bootstrap of permission strings into the browser session upon logging in.
              We found that managing permissions through this plugin helped us decrease user login times.  The code base also improved
              since we had an expressive way describe what users were allowed to access which page.
