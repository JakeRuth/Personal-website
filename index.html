              I have experience with AWS and have used a many services they offer.

            </p>
            <p>
              I created the mobile application Youni (no longer on app store) as apart of a startup venture I took on, acting
              as the Lead Developer and CTO.  The app was developed with <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a>
              for the front-end.  I prototyped an API using Grails, the API was the real brain of the application that
              handled everything from authentication to generating post feeds and more.  The front end React Native project
              was lean and only served as a light rendering engine that made calls to the API.  The API was hosted using services
              provided by AWS.  I used MongoDB as my datastore.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reflection:  I am happy with the performanace of the app.  It handled thousands of users and thanks to AWS I was
              able to host the API in a scalable load balanced environment that scaled accordingly as the API received more traffic.
              In hindsight I would choose a different technology to create the API, since Grails had a slow startup time and
              was a bit heavy weight for what I needed.

            <p>
              View the plugin <a href="https://grails.org/plugin/shiro-guard">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note: I created this plugin during the summer of 2014 while I was a full-time intern at
              <a href="http://www.commercehub.com/">CommerceHub</a>.  It is now deprecated and no longer maintained.
              However it is important to note this plugin was used in production for two years and it was a great personal accomplishment at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
              This plugin builds upon the <a href="http://grails.org/plugin/shiro">Apache Shiro Plugin</a> by adding a way to check to see if a user can
              access a URL, at the time of the request.  Without this plugin an authenticated user would gain permission to RESTful URLs either
              through a Role DB object, or through a bootstrap of permission strings into the browser session upon logging in.
              We found that managing permissions through this plugin helped us decrease user login times.  The code base also improved
              since we had an expressive way describe which users were allowed to access certain pages within our app.

            <p>
  						When I was a junior in college I began a private contract with My Plastic Brain Inc.  My job was to develop a multitude of html5 compliant
  						web games that were catered towards cognitive development.  Over the course of the contract I developed 30 different games.
  						I used the JavaScript framework <a href="http://kineticjs.com/">KineticJS</a> to create them (KineticJS is now deprecated and abondoned).
              I consistently communicated with the client over the phone to receive and collaborate on requirements for
              the various games.  I also onboarded and trained a friend create the games, he then started a contract with the company.

            <p>
              I re-coded the game 2048 as a html5 compliant web browser game.
  						I was inspired to re-code the game was because when I played the app version, the animations were too slow and it
  						slowed down my game play.  I used <a href="http://kineticjs.com/">KineticJS</a> (no longer supported) to develop the game.
              It's important to note I never looked at pre-written code for 2048, I used my own wit to slowly figure out how to create it.
              At the time I created this I was still pretty new to web programming.  The code is stringy to say the least and the code quality is poor.
              I decided to put this on my portfolio because it demonstrates my creativity and ambition/motiviation to create software projects.
              On a positive note, you can button mash this game and abuse the arrow keys.  The tile animation is .03 seconds and this game
              can handle the fastest and most furious players.
