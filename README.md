Created with the help of [Pure css](https://www.google.com Pure's Homepage")

I chose Pure over other popular choices such as Foundation and Bootstrap because Pure is very simple and only provides the base building blocks for creating a simple webpage.  Other popular frameworks like those listed above are huge and opinionated, and while they are useful for building big web applications for my simple website it didn't make the cut.

Quote from Pure's website: `Pure is ridiculously tiny. The entire set of modules clocks in at 4.0KB* minified and gzipped.`

Feel free to fork/copy/pull request... anything your heart desires.  I love hearing other people's opinions!
