Created with the help of
* [Pure css](http://purecss.io/)
  * Small/simple css lib to help style my site
* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
  * Well known front-end framework that uses JavaScript to provide rich features/syntax to build wicked cool UIs.

It's me own person website! I try to keep this up to date/just have fun with it.
Mostly just amused to own the domain with my full name, so I feel it should have some static content ya know?

Feel free to fork/copy/pull request... anything your heart desires.  I love hearing other people's opinions!
