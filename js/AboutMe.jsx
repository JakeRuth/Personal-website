            I Love Coding
          </h3>
          <p>
            I nerd out over all things code.  Software engineering isn't just a job for me, it's a hobby.
            I write code in my freetime/read up on coding articles/news/etc.

            Great Teammate
          </h3>
          <p>
            One part of engineering I like is working on teams, likely due to a lot of sports I used to play.
            I enjoy building, growing, succeeding, and failing together with others.

            Full Stack Developer
          </h3>
          <p>
            No part of the stack is safe.  I like to split my time between frontend/JS and backend programming.
            I also enjoy writing infrastructure code/dev ops like teams.

            I'm Unique!
          </h3>
          <p>
            I love trying out new things and experimenting!  A few interesting hobbies I've picked up have been
            speed cubing, trick unicycling, and hiking, to name a few.
